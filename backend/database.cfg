# Database Configuration
# 
# IMPORTANT: This file is for backwards compatibility only.
# For new deployments, use environment variables instead:
# - STAGING_DATABASE_URL for staging environment
# - PRODUCTION_DATABASE_URL for production environment  
# - LOCAL_DATABASE_URL for local development (optional)
#
# The application will automatically detect the environment and use
# the appropriate database configuration. Local development uses
# mock data by default unless LOCAL_DATABASE_URL is configured.
