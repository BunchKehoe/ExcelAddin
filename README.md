## ‚ú® Features

- **üìä Task Pane Interface** - Modern React-based UI with Material-UI components
- **üßÆ Custom Functions** - Two powerful custom functions available in Excel:
  - `PC.AGGIRR(expectedFutureValue, originalBeginningValue)` - Calculate aggregate IRR
  - `PC.JOINCELLS(range, delimiter)` - Join cell ranges with custom delimiters
- **üîß Multi-Environment Support** - Configured for local development, staging, and production
- **üöÄ Modern Build System** - Webpack-based with TypeScript, hot reloading, and optimized production builds

## Quick Start

### For Local Development
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install
cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Start development server
npm run dev                    # Runs on https://localhost:3000

# 3. Load in Excel
# Developer tab ‚Üí Add-ins ‚Üí Upload manifest.xml
```

### Testing Custom Functions
Once loaded in Excel, try these examples:
```excel
=PC.AGGIRR(150, 100)           # Returns 1.5
=PC.JOINCELLS(A1:A5, " | ")    # Joins A1-A5 with " | "
```

## üåç Environment Support

| Environment | URL | Manifest | Build Command |
|-------------|-----|----------|---------------|
