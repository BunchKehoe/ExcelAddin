## üñ•Ô∏è Local Development Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ installed
- Git
- Office Add-in SSL certificates (required for local development)

### Setup & Run

#### Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies
```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repository>
cd ExcelAddin
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Generate Office Add-in SSL Certificates
Office Add-ins require HTTPS connections, even for local development. Generate the required SSL certificates:

```bash
# Install certificates (creates ~/.office-addin-dev-certs/ directory)
npm run cert:install

# Verify certificates are properly installed
npm run cert:verify
```

**Certificate Details:**
- **Location:** `~/.office-addin-dev-certs/`
- **Files Created:**
  - `localhost.crt` - SSL certificate for localhost
  - `localhost.key` - Private key for the certificate
- **Validity:** These certificates are trusted by your system for Office Add-in development

**Troubleshooting Certificate Issues:**
If you encounter certificate problems:
```bash
# Uninstall existing certificates
npm run cert:uninstall

# Reinstall fresh certificates
npm run cert:install

# Verify installation
npm run cert:verify
```

#### Step 3: Start Development Server
```bash
# Start development server with HTTPS
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

The development server will automatically use the SSL certificates from `~/.office-addin-dev-certs/` for secure HTTPS connections required by Office Add-ins.

### Development URLs
- **Frontend:** https://localhost:3000
- **Task Pane:** https://localhost:3000/taskpane.html
- **Commands:** https://localhost:3000/commands.html
- **Functions Metadata:** https://localhost:3000/functions.json

### Testing Custom Functions Locally
1. Open Excel
2. Go to Insert > My Add-ins > Upload My Add-in
3. Select `manifest.xml` from the project root
4. Use functions in Excel: `=PC.AGGIRR(100, 50)` or `=PC.JOINCELLS(A1:A3, "; ")`

### Local Development Checklist
- [ ] `npm install` completed successfully
- [ ] SSL certificates installed (`npm run cert:verify`)
- [ ] Development server starts without errors (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] All pages load: taskpane.html, commands.html
- [ ] functions.json is accessible
- [ ] Custom functions work in Excel
- [ ] Backend API responds (if applicable)

## üß™ Staging Environment Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Access to staging server: `server-vs81t.intranet.local`
- IIS with SSL configured on port 9443
- PowerShell execution privileges
- SSL certificates properly configured on staging server

**Important:** Staging builds use the production webpack configuration (`webpack.prod.config.js`) which does not require Office Add-in development certificates. The staging server handles SSL through IIS configuration.

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# 1. Prepare staging build
npm run clean
npm install
npm run build:staging
```

### Deployment to IIS (Staging)
```powershell
# Run as Administrator on staging server
.\deployment\scripts\deploy-to-existing-iis.ps1

.\deployment\scripts\test-iis-simple.ps1
```

### Staging URLs

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Functions Guide

### Available Functions
1. **PC.AGGIRR(expectedFutureValue, originalBeginningValue)**
   - Calculates aggregate IRR by dividing future value by beginning value
   - Example: `=PC.AGGIRR(150, 100)` returns `1.5`

2. **PC.JOINCELLS(range, [delimiter])**
   - Joins cells from a range with specified delimiter (default: comma)
   - Example: `=PC.JOINCELLS(A1:A5, " | ")` returns cells joined with " | "

### Troubleshooting Custom Functions
- **Functions not visible:** Check manifest.xml has CustomFunctions ExtensionPoint
- **Functions not working:** Verify functions.json is accessible
- **Namespace issues:** Confirm namespace "PC" in manifest matches usage

## üîß Certificate & HTTPS Troubleshooting

### Common Certificate Issues

#### Issue: "Office Add-in certificates not found" warning
**Solution:**
```bash
npm run cert:install
npm run cert:verify
```

#### Issue: "Failed to load webpack.config.js - ENOENT: localhost.key"
This indicates the development configuration is trying to use certificates that don't exist.
**Solution:**
1. Install Office Add-in certificates: `npm run cert:install`
2. Or use the fallback HTTPS configuration (automatic in updated webpack config)

#### Issue: Excel doesn't trust the development server
**Symptoms:** 
- Excel shows security warnings
- Add-in won't load from localhost
- "This add-in is not secure" messages

**Solution:**
```bash
# Uninstall and reinstall certificates
npm run cert:uninstall
npm run cert:install

# Verify certificates are trusted
npm run cert:verify
```

#### Issue: Different certificate requirements per environment
**Understanding:**
- **Local Development:** Uses Office Add-in development certificates in `~/.office-addin-dev-certs/`
- **Staging/Production:** Uses server-managed SSL certificates through IIS
- **Webpack configs:** Development vs production configs handle certificates differently

**Configuration:**
- Development webpack config auto-detects and uses Office Add-in certificates
- Production/staging webpack configs rely on server SSL configuration
- No cross-configuration conflicts
